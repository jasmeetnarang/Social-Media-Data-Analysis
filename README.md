## Social Media Data Analysis

In this project we learn how to crawl social media data and use some network measures to analyse it.
For our project we chose Twitter as the social media platform and created a Friendship network. 
To analyse the  network we used the following measures:
1. Degree Distribution
2. Clustering Coefficient
3. Closeness Centrality

Following is the process to run the source code:

    #To simply run the network measure on the saved data
    python main.py
    
    #To crawl new data from twitter and run the network measures on it
    python DataProcessing.py
    python main.py

##### Additional Information:
1. The final data is named screen_names.txt and can be accessed from data/screen_names.txt. 
2. To access the final result plots go to Images folder
3. A template for util file is also attached for reference
